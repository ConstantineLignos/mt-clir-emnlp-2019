# The Challenges of Optimizing Machine Translation for Low Resource Cross-Language Information Retrieval

This repository will hold the data preprocessing scripts and
experiments used in the EMNLP 2019 paper "The Challenges of Optimizing
Machine Translation for Low Resource Cross-Language Information
Retrieval". These are not yet available due to the delay caused by
first author changing affiliations while the paper was under review,
but should be available later in Fall 2019.

For more information, contact Constantine Lignos using the information
at https://lignos.org/.
